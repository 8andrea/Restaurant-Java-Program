## Restaurant.Java
# User Interactions - Main Method
  * I used JOptionPane dialog boxes to collect restaurant information from the user
  * The input values were passed into the constructor to store inside the restaurant object. 

# Getters and Setters - Restaurant Class
  * Since we created private data fields, for encapsulation, I used Getters to get the information from the Restaurant class in the main method and used Setters to set the values when calling to them.

# ArrayLits - Main Method
  * I instantiated an ArrayList<Restaurant> to store Restaurant objects. This lets me store multiple restaurants instead of just one.

# toString() Method - Restaurant Class
  * I used the toString() method to format how an object prints in a readable and clean way just like format string in python.
